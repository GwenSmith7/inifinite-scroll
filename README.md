This was a harder project as some of the syntax was new to me.

What I learned:

- worked with API integration to grab the images from another website (all images are grabbed from Unsplash)
- worked with arrays and functions
- created an if statement to determine when more images should load
- learned how to use .setAttribute() which was new to me
